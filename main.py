# comments start with hash
# Python has several implementations:
# 1. CPython (default implementation) (in C)
# 2. Jython (in Java)
# 3. IronPython (in C#)
# 4. PyPy (Subset of python)

# C program -> C Compiler -> Machine Code (Readable by Machine)
# In case of C, the machine code is machine specific (actually CPU specific) and machine code for one operating system will not work for another operating system

# Java program -> Java Compiler -> Java bytecode -> Java Virtual Machine -> Machine Code
# Java virtual machine converts the bytecode into respective machine code

# C# and CPython work the save way as java

# We can use Java in Python (Jython implementation not in CPython)
# In case of Jython the end result is not Python bytecode, it is Java bytecode
